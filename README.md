# CompayWidget
I originally made this little widget with AutoHotKey to gather commonly used forms and files for my company, but it is slowly becoming a central hub for many of the services I'm building.  It takes up a small portion of the screen by using drop down menus.  It's not too complex but allows for easy editing and updating.  I have it showing our company logo which looks pretty slick, but any small image will do.  It is always on top for easy access and it is dragable so you can move it out of the way when needed.  You place a .txt file in a directory of your choice to close all instances so that you can update any changes across all users.  Feel free to use if it suits your needs.
